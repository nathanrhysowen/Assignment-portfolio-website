        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Nathan Owen. I am a student studying Digital Media at University Of The West of England Bristol. 
            Originally from Carlisle, <br>I moved down to Bristol to study my course. I have created this website as a portfolio to showcase the skills i have learned through my <br>course so far, 
             ranging from knowledge of Adobe products like Indesign, illustrator 
            and photoshop, to HTML and CSS programming. </p>

     <!--task1-->

         <h1 class = "task1">Task 1</h1>
         <p>The first task of the module introduced me to the very <br>basic fundamentals of HTML, including the body tag. It <br> also introduced me to Gitchub. Both of which i had no<br> prior knowledge of. Even though it was a very simple <br> task, it 
            helped me understand the basic structure of<br> HTML  programming. </p>

     <!--task2-->

         <h1  class = "task2" id= "task2">Task 2</h1>
         <p id = "task2p" class = "task2p">The second task of the module introduced me to CSS, which <br> allowed me to design and decorate the webpage with colour. <br> I also learned how
             to add images into a webpage. This is<br> where the programming began to get more fun and interesting, <br> as I enjoy the process of making the layout
             of the webpage<br> look nice. At this point I was still unsure about HTML and CSS <br> programming however it definitely gave me more confidence.
         </p>

     <!--task3-->

         <h1 class = "task3" id = "task3">Task 3</h1>
         <p class = "task3p" id = "task3p">The third task of the module expanded the CSS knowledge <br> we used in the previous task by making me link to a <br>seperate page within the first page in the previous task. <br>
             This task introduced concepts such as: selectors,styling <br>elements,border,padding and flexbox. 
             All of which I have <br> been using within this portfolio website. 
             I remember finding <br> this task slightly more challenging than the previous tasks <br> since it introduced so many new concepts and i was still <br> new to HTML and CSS 
             however, I still found it fun <br> regardless.  </p>
             <img src = "images/worksheet_three_screenshot.JPG" class = "worksheet3" id = "worksheet3">
             <a target= "_blank" class = "worksheet3_github" id = "worksheet3_github" href = "https://github.com/nathanrhysowen/HTML-worksheet-2">Github link</a>
   
     <!--task4-->
         
         <h1 class = "task4" id = "task4">Task 4</h1>
         <p class = "task4p" id = "task4p"> The fourth task of the module delved deeper into flexbox, which <br> was touched upon in the previous task.
             I learned how to style <br> my buttons using flexbox. I also learned how to turn my buttons <br> into real working buttons by placing an anchor
             link inside of them <br> using the anchor tag that sends the user to the specified link. I <br> found this task less challenging than the previous one
             ,as I was <br> more familiar with the way that CSS worked, however, I did have <br> trouble trying to position my flexbox buttons as they weren't going<br> where
             I wanted them. </p>

     <!--task5-->

          <h1 class = "task5" id = "task5">Task 5</h1>
          <p class = "task5p" id = "task5p"> The fifth task of the module introduced me to the 'button' tag and making <br> linking buttons which linked to a duplicate of my first page. This task also <br> showed me how to make a carousel, which helped me make the one I'm using <br>here. I also re designed the colour pallette to colours I thought looked nicer <br>together. </p>

        <p class = "design1p" id = "design1p">In the first design, I decided to place both texts inside two circles as a form of repition. <br>I also warped the 
            text however I scratched this idea in my final design because i thought <br> that the text was too hard to read which 
            was a design flaw. I split the page diagonally and <br> made one half white and the other red because i like the contrast
            between the two colours. <br> The logo is also placed in the center to align it with the diagonal split since the logo is 
            also <br> split in half. 
        </p>

         <p class = "design2p" id = "design2p">For my second design i decided to split the page again but this time horizontally in the middle <br>
            and keep the white and red contrasting colour scheme. I curved the seperation line instead of <br> making it straight because it makes it look as if 
            the red is paint oozing across the canvas. I <br> seperated the two texts with a diagonal line as a form of repitition similar to how the T and F <br> in the
            logo is seperated and aligned the text so that there is white space above and below it.
         </p>

         <p class = "design3p" id = "design3p">In my 3rd design i split the page horizontally yet again, however this time with a straight line <br> to see how it looked.
             What sets this design apart from the rest is the use of the spraypaint <br> effect behind the text wich is repeated for the title. I mirrored the colours of the  text with the <br> spray paint behind 
             to contrast the colours. I also alligned all the text within the center of the<br> page.  </p>

         <p class = "finaldesignp" id = "finaldesignp">For my final design, I tried to incorporate ideas from all of my previous designs. For the title, I <br> repeated the colour scheme from the logo by making the "true" 
             black and "false" white. In <br> addition, I also borrowed the spray paint idea from my previous design and spray painted red <br> behind the "false", mirroring the logo.
            I also used the curved line from my previous design to <br> further push the idea of paint. The poster is for a film festival and so the reference to paint fits <br>in my opinon, as both 
            film and paint are linked with the art of creation. I split both texts with a <br> diagonal line repeating the pattern from the logo and alligned the text to follow the line. In all <br> of my designs
            I refrained from adding pictures, this is because I am a fan of minimalist design <br> and did not want the page to be too cluttered and would prefer it if there is more white space.<br> I stuck to
            only 2 contrasting colours to further push the minimilist design.  </p>
