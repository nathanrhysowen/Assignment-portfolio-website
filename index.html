        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Nathan Owen. I am a student studying Digital Media at University Of The West of England Bristol. 
            Originally from Carlisle, <br>I moved down to Bristol to study my course. I have created this website as a portfolio to showcase the skills i have learned through my <br>course so far, 
             ranging from knowledge of Adobe products like Indesign, illustrator 
            and photoshop, to HTML and CSS programming. </p>

     <!--task1-->

         <h1 class = "task1">Task 1</h1>
         <p>The first task of the module introduced me to the very <br>basic fundamentals of HTML, including the body tag. It <br> also introduced me to Gitchub. Both of which i had no<br> prior knowledge of. Even though it was a very simple <br> task, it 
            helped me understand the basic structure of<br> HTML  programming. </p>

         <h1  class = "task2" id= "task2">Task 2</h1>
         <p id = "task2p" class = "task2p">The second task of the module introduced me to CSS, which <br> allowed me to design and decorate the webpage with colour. <br> I also learned how
             to add images into a webpage. This is<br> where the programming began to get more fun and interesting, <br> as I enjoy the process of making the layout
             of the webpage<br> look nice. At this point I was still unsure about HTML and CSS <br> programming however it definitely gave me more confidence.

         <h1 class = "task3" id = "task3">Task 3</h1>
         <p class = "task3p" id = "task3p">The third task of the module expanded the CSS knowledge <br> we used in the previous task by making me link to a <br>seperate page within the first page in the previous task. <br>
             This task introduced concepts such as: selectors,styling <br>elements,border,padding and flexbox. 
             All of which I have <br> been using within this portfolio website. 
             I remember finding <br> this task slightly more challenging than the previous tasks <br> since it introduced so many new concepts and i was still <br> new to HTML and CSS 
             however, I still found it fun <br> regardless.  </p>

     <!--task4-->
         
         <h1 class = "task4" id = "task4">Task 4</h1>
         <p class = "task4p" id = "task4p"> The fourth task of the module delved deeper into flexbox, which <br> was touched upon in the previous task.
             I learned how to style <br> my buttons using flexbox. I also learned how to turn my buttons <br> into real working buttons by placing an anchor
             link inside of them <br> using the anchor tag that sends the user to the specified link. I <br> found this task less challenging than the previous one
             ,as I was <br> more familiar with the way that CSS worked, however, I did have <br> trouble trying to position my flexbox buttons as they weren't going<br> where
             I wanted them. </p>

          <h1 class = "task5" id = "task5">Task 5</h1>
          <p class = "task5p" id = "task5p"> The fifth task of the module introduced me to the 'button' tag and making <br> linking buttons which linked to a duplicate of my first page. This task also <br> showed me how to make a carousel, which helped me make the one I'm using <br>here. I also re designed the colour pallette to colours I thought looked nicer <br>together. </p>

        <p class = "design1p" id = "design1p">In the first design, I decided to place both texts inside two circles as a form of repition. <br>I also warped the 
            text however I scratched this idea in my final design because i thought <br> that the text was too hard to read which 
            was a design flaw. I split the page diagonally and <br> made one half white and the other red because i like the contrast
            between the two colours. <br> The logo is also placed in the center to align it with the diagonal split since the logo is 
            also <br> split in half. 
        </p>

         <p class = "design2p" id = "design2p">For my second design i decided to split the page again but this time horizontally in the middle <br>
            and keep the white and red contrasting colour scheme. I curved the seperation line instead of <br> making it straight because it makes it look as if 
            the red is paint oozing across the canvas. I <br> seperated the two texts with a diagonal line as a form of repitition similar to how the T and F <br> in the
            logo is seperated and aligned the text so that there is white space above and below it.
         </p>

         <p class = "design3p" id = "design3p">In my 3rd design i split the page horizontally yet again, however this time with a straight line <br> to see how it looked.
             What sets this design apart from the rest is the use of the spraypaint <br> effect behind the text wich is repeated for the title. I mirrored the colours of the  text with the <br> spray paint behind 
             to contrast the colours. I also alligned all the text within the center of the<br> page.  </p>

         <p class = "finaldesignp" id = "finaldesignp">For my final design, I tried to incorporate ideas from all of my previous designs. For the title, I <br> repeated the colour scheme from the logo by making the "true" 
             black and "false" white. In <br> addition, I also borrowed the spray paint idea from my previous design and spray painted red <br> behind the "false", mirroring the logo.
            I also used the curved line from my previous design to <br> further push the idea of paint. The poster is for a film festival and so the reference to paint fits <br>in my opinon, as both 
            film and paint are linked with the art of creation. I split both texts with a <br> diagonal line repeating the pattern from the logo and alligned the text to follow the line. In all <br> of my designs
            I refrained from adding pictures, this is because I am a fan of minimalist design <br> and did not want the page to be too cluttered and would prefer it if there is more white space.<br> I stuck to
            only 2 contrasting colours to further push the minimilist design.  </p>

            <h1 class = "slide1h">Slide 1: Axial</h1>
            <p class = "slide1p">An axial design is a design that centers around an axis. It doesn't matter if it is symmetrical or not, as long as the design is centered around an axis, it is an axial design. For example, in my design, I placed a triangle on the left side of the canvas and used the diagonal line through the center of the canvas as the axis that the text is placed on. For all of my designs I used the font Futura PT. I chose this font from the others because I liked the round edges and felt like it fit the look of the website I would be eventually placing it on. This is also why I chose to make all of the designs blue, since I had planned that my website was going to have a blue colour palette. </p>
            
            <h1 class = "slide2h">Slide 2: Radial</h1>
            <p class = "slide2p">A radial design is layed out in a way where there is a central point with with text radiating from that point. For example, in my design I placed a semi circle to the right of the page and made the text radiate from the left of it. With any design it is important to think about the hierarchy of the text, which piece of text is the most and least important. I placed the title in the centre of the image and made it the biggest because I believe the users eyes will be drawn to the center of the image first. </p>
        
            <h1 class = "slide3h">Slide 3: Dilatational</h1>
            <p class = "slide3p"> A dilatational design is a design that is set along circular paths. Thankfully in Illustrator there is a "type along a path" tool that helped a bunch with this layout. For my design, I placed 6 blue circles on the canvas and wrapped the text around them. I placed the title in the top left of the canvas since, atleast in the west, we are engrained to read from left to right and since i couldn't dictate the text hierarchy based on size since the largest piece of text needed the largest circle.</p>
        
            <h1 class = "slide4h">Slide 4: Random</h1>
            <p class = "slide4p">A random design is exactly that, random. It is not dictated by any specific layout. In my opinion, this design was the hardest out of them all because it's a difficult task to make something so random and yet still look appealing. For my design I enclosed the title inbetween two lines and placed the rest of the text at the bottom and top of the page. Each piece of text is a different size to accentuate the "randomness" of the image.</p>

            <h1 class = "slide5h">Slide 5: Grid</h1>
            <p class = "slide5p"> A grid design is a design where the layout is specified by a grid. For mine, I used the grid layout on Illustrator by making sure that every single piece of text was inside one of the grid boxes. The title lies ontop of one of the grid lines and the text is placed below that line. This layout seems to be one of the most popular layouts, particularly for websites. Most likely beacuse of it's easy to read and clean design. I definietly found this layout the easiest as the fact that I had to restrict myself to using grids meant that I didnt have to think too much about how my text was going to look.</p>
     
            <h1 class = "slide6h">Slide 6: Modular</h1>
            <p class = "slide6p">A modular design is characterised by repeating structures or images that seperate or contain the text. For example, in my design I used the repeating structure of blue squares that contain each piece of text. I made sure that each square was exactly the same size and that the spaces between each square are exactly the same so that it is all uniform.</p>
        
            <h1 class = "slide7h">Slide 7: Transitional</h1>
            <p class = "slide7p"> The transitional design was, at first, hard to wrap my head around as it was difficult to find a definition. Type365.com defines it as " they look like the cross section earth–with layers of sediment and stone." Once i read this definition I then understood the concept. In my design, I warped each piece of text to make it seem as if it was layered, and I created a wavy blue blackground to enforce that idea. </p>
        
            <h1 class = "slide8h">Slide 8: Bilateral</h1>
            <p class = "slide8p">Bilateral designs are centered designs that are symetrical. For my design, I placed 3 lines vertically down the page, each seperated with the same amount of space, and placed the text down the center of the page going through the lines. </p>

                <p class = "stratp">The fundemental goal of this website is to display all of my tasks completed in this module in a way that is easy to read and nice to look at. In addition, another goal is to fulfill the assignment requirements to a standard that I, myself, am happy with. The users of the website are teachers, possibly parents/grandparents, friends and me. When designing the website it is important to note the different users and how each user will navigate the page and react. For example, I will purposely make the navigation menu easy to find at the top of the page, so that users who are not familiar with navigating many websites (my grandparents) will hopefully instinctively click on those buttons. The website is ocean themed and will contain the CARP task, the coding tasks, the type task and UX task all on one page so that when the user is scrolling down it looks like the user is getting deeper and deeper into the ocean.</p>

                <p>This website was a blast to make, learning all of the techniques I needed was very interesting and I enjoyed implementing them onto the site. If I could do this again later on when my knowledge of CSS and HTMl is broader I would make the website feel more fluid and interactive. The image sliders were by far the hardest part of the whole project, for some reason, it was difficult to get them to be the proper width and height while also making sure they accurately slide. This website also has issues of scalability where texts and images will display in different positions depending on the screen size. As scalability is not the focus of this module, I decided to leave it as is but for the next assignments it is definitely something I will need to worry about. Another thing I found quite difficult was the animations for the title and pictures at the top of the page. I had to find a way to make the images move as the user scrolled down the page and the best solution I could find was to use Javascript. Thankfully, the creative coding module helped a lot with this, as now I had a basic knowledge of the programming language. I found a tutorial on youtube (which will be linked at the bottom of this paragraph) that helped me write the code out myself and apply it for my own website. Considering at the beginning of the assignment I had no prior knowledge of HTML or CSS, I am proud of the work I've been able to achieve and hope to build upon it in future assignments. </p>
